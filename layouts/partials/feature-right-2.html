                        <p class="card-text mt-2">Proxy Accelerator is a set of technologies unique to Smarter Guardians Proxy that can
                            increase your proxy connection speeds by up to 400%.

                            Proxy Accelerator dramatically increases performance by overcoming CPU limitations that affect
                            how proxy protocols are processed, using advanced networking techniques to reduce latency, and
                            redesigning proxy protocols themselves to reduce inefficiencies in their code.</p>

                        <p class="card-text mt-2">Smarter Guardians Proxy's Secure Core architecture gives you the unique ability to
                            defend against network-based attacks. Secure Core protects your connection by routing your
                            traffic through multiple servers before leaving our network.

                            This means an advanced adversary who can monitor the network traffic at the exit server will
                            not be able to discover your true IP address or match your browsing activity to your IP
                            address.

                            Secure Core servers are located in hardened data centers in Switzerland, Iceland, and
                            Sweden, protected by strong privacy laws, and operated on our own dedicated networks.</p>

                        <p class="card-text mt-2">Smarter Guardians Proxy's Stealth is a unique proxy protocol that evades detection
                            and allows you to bypass most firewalls and proxy blocking methods.

                            Unlike other proxy services, weâ€™re deeply committed to advancing freedom and developing new
                            technologies to beat censorship worldwide.

                            For instance, our alternative routing technology bypasses internet blocks by rerouting
                            connections over other paths.

                            Similarly, our Stealth proxy protocol fights censorship by making your proxy traffic look like
                            regular traffic, allowing you to access otherwise blocked information.</p>
