                <p class=""> Proton was founded in Geneva, Switzerland, by scientists who met at the European
                    Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and today remains led by scientists. In line with our
                    scientific DNA, Smarter Guardians Proxy is open source and publicly audited. Our security claims are
                    not
                    merely claims, but facts that anybody can verify.</p>
